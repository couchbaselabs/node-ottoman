# Building Your First App

## Prepare Couchbase Server

Download and install Couchbase Server 4.0 Enterprise.   The enterprise version of the product is absolutely free to use in any development capacity.  The latest version can be downloaded from our website.  After installing, open your browser to port 8091 where Couchbase is installed, and the graphical UI will walk through the setup process.  For the purpose of this walkthrough and application, we’re going to assume Couchbase is installed on the same system the application will be developed on.   To connect to the instance of Couchbase that was installed, open a browser to http://127.0.0.1:8091.   Be sure to select all thee services Data, Index, Query on the “Configure Server” page under “Start a new Cluster”.  We’ll need these for building our sample application.

We don’t need to use one of the included sample buckets with this tutorial.  Click next on the page that says “Sample Buckets” without selecting any.  Continue through the setup, adding a default bucket and now we should be ready to continue on with building our application.

## Prepare Our Project Folder

Install Node.js from the [Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/).  Once Node.js is installed, we can bootstrap our application.   Create a directory and clone the repository on GitHub.

From the Terminal:
```bash
​$ git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/bikeshop-cb.git
$ cd bikeshop-cb
```

The package.json file in the root directory of the application lists the dependencies for the application.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "express": "*",
    "couchbase": "~2.3.0",
    "body-parser": "*",
    "ottoman":"~1.0.2"
}
```

Now we are ready to actually install all the dependancies we will need.
From the Terminal:
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Tutorial Project (bikeshop) Goals

The requirements of this application are:

- Inventory application for catalogueing bikes.
- The application must store Customer and Sales Person information to track test rides and purchase information.
- Couchbase will be the system of record.

### Data Model

The flexiblity and dynamic nature of a NOSQL Document Database and JSON simplifies building the data model.  For the bikeshop application we will use three types of objects, and we'll define those in specific modules in the node application.   

- customers
- employees
- bikes
 
A folder under the root of the application called `/schema` is where the data model is defined, and in `/schema/model` separate model files for each object is defined there.   Lets walk through the data model starting with the `customer.js` module.

### Customer Model

The first section of the customer.js module instantiates module dependencies, which are Ottoman and the database file where the information on the Couchbase instance is stored for this particular example. 

```javascript
var db = require('./../db.js');	      // ← use the database object 
var ottoman = require('ottoman');    // ← use ottoman
```

Next a custom validator function is defined to make sure a phone number in the standard USA format is created.

```javascript
function PhoneValidator(val) {
  var phoneno = /^\(?([0-9]{3})\)?[-. ]?([0-9]{3})[-. ]?([0-9]{4})$/;
  if(val && !val.match(phoneno)) {
    throw new Error('Phone number is invalid.');
  }
}
```

The model for the Customer object is defined, using several of the built in types that Ottoman supports.   For additional reference, see http://www.ottomanjs.com.   Several indices are defined along with the model.  The indices are utilized as methods for each instance of the Customer Object.   Ottoman supports complex data types, embedded references to other models, and customization.  

```javascript
var CustomerMdl = ottoman.model('Customer', {
  customerID: { type:'string', auto:'uuid', readonly:true }, // ← auto-increment UUID
  createdON: { type:'Date', default:new Date() },            // ← auto populate date field
  name: {                                                    // ← embedded string document
    first: 'string',
    last: 'string'
  },
  address: {                                                 // ← embedded address document
    street: 'string',
    city: 'string',
    state: 'string',
    zip: 'integer',
    country: { type:'string', default:'USA' }                // ← auto populate string 
  },
  phone: { type:'string', validator:PhoneValidator },        // ← string using custom validator 
  email: 'string',
  history: [{                                                // ← array of historical events
    date: { type: 'Date', default:new Date() },
    employee: 'Employee',                                    // ← reference to another ottoman object
    interaction: 'string',
    notes: 'string'
  }],
  active: { type:'boolean', default:true }
},{
  index: {	
    findByCustomerID: {            // ← refdoc index
      by: 'customerID',
      type: 'refdoc'
    },
    findByEmail: {                 // ← refdoc index
      by: 'email',
      type: 'refdoc'
    },
    findByFirstName: {             // ← secondary index
      by: 'name.first'
    },
    findByLastName: {              // ← secondary index
      by: 'name.last'
    }
  }
});
```

In the Customer model above, there are four explicit indexes defined. By default, if an index type is not specified Ottoman will select the fastest available index supported within the current Couchbase cluster. In addition to utilizing built in secondary index support within Couchbase, Ottoman can also utilize referential documents and maintain the referential integrity for updates and deletes. This is a powerful features that allows for blazingly fast lookups by a particular field. This type of index in Ottoman is useful for finding a particular object by a unique field such as customer id or email address in the example above. In addition to any explicit index, Ottoman also provides a generic find capability using the query api and N1QL. 

The next block of code in the Customer model is function that allows the application to create and save a new instance of a Customer in one step. The method "create" is a default method provided by Ottoman for objects as a convenience.  It's also possible to instantiate a new object, assign all of the fields and then save the object using the "save" method that Ottoman provides for each object.  An example of doing it this way is included in the Bike Model below. Lastly, the Ottoman model of the Customer is exported for use in other modules.

```javascript
CustomerMdl.createAndSave = function (firstname, lastname, addrStreet, addrCity, addrState, addrZip, email, done) {
  this.create({
    name: {
      first: firstname,
      last: lastname
    },
    address: {
      street: addrStreet,
      city: addrCity,
      state: addrState,
      zip: addrZip
    },
    email: email
  }, done);
};

module.exports = CustomerMdl;	
``` 


### Bike Model

The `bike.js` module begins much the same way as the `customer.js` module. It's important to note here that objects that are referenced by other ottoman objects do not need to be declared specifically as node dependencies modules within other modules. For example, to define a field as a reference in the `Bike` model to the `Customer` model defined above, it's not necessary to include the `customer.js` module as a reference. 

```javascript
var db = require('./../db.js');	      // ← use the database object 
var ottoman = require('ottoman');    // ← use ottoman
```

As in the Customer model example, the Bike object is defined with several different data types, embedded references to other Ottoman models and explicitly defined secondary indexes. 

```javascript
var BikeMdl = ottoman.model('Bike', {
  stockID: { type:'string', auto:'uuid', readonly:true },   // ← auto Increment UUID
  acquiredON: { type: 'Date', default:Date.now },           // ← auto populate date function
  vin: 'string',
  make: 'string',
  model: 'string',
  year: 'integer',
  description: 'string',
  condition: 'string',
  price: 'number',
  status: 'string',
  mileage: 'integer',
  photos: [{type:'string'}],                                // ← array of strings, URLS to photos
  rides: [{                                                 // ← array of test rides
    customer: {ref:'Customer'},	                             // ← reference to another Ottoman object
    employee: {ref:'Employee'},                             // ← reference to another Ottoman object
    date: 'Date',
    miles: 'number'
  }],
  sale: {                                                   // ← embedded sale document 
    customer: {ref:'Customer'},	                             // ← reference to another Ottoman object
    employee: {ref:'Employee'},	                             // ← reference to another Ottoman object
    amount: 'number',
    warranty: 'number',
    date: { type:'Date', default:Date.now }                 // ← auto populate date function
  }
}, {
  index: {
    findByStockID: {            // ← refdoc index
      type: 'refdoc',
      by: 'stockID'
    },
    findByMake: {               // ← secondary index
      by: 'make'
    },
    findByYear: {               // ← secondary index
      by: 'year'
    },
    findByCondition: {          // ← secondary index
      by: 'condition'
    },
    findByStatus: {             // ← secondary index
      by: 'status'
    },
    findByVin: {                // ← refdoc index
      type: 'refdoc',
      by: 'vin'
    }
  }
});
```

The indexes like in the customer example are a mix of refdoc indexes and default secondary indexes. Just as in the customer module a shorthand create and save method is utilized for instantiating a new instance of the Bike object. 

```javascript
BikeMdl.createAndSave = function(vin, year, make, model, description, condition, mileage, price, done) {
  this.create({
    vin: vin,
    year: year,
    make: make,
    model: model,
    description: description,
    condition: condition,
    mileage: mileage,
    price: price
  }, done);
};
```

An example of the same sequence of instantiating a new object, assigning values to all the fields and then saving the object used in the shorthand function above is shown for reference. 

```javascript
BikeMdl.createAndSaveLongform = function(vin, year, make, model, description, condition, mileage, price, done) {
  var bike = new BikeMdl();           // ← create a new object from model
  bike.vin = vin;
  bike.year = year;
  bike.make = make;
  bike.model = model
  bike.description = description;
  bike.condition = condition;
  bike.mileage = mileage;
  bike.price = price;

  bike.save(function(err){            // ← save the object
    if(err) return done(err);
    done(null, bike);
  });
};
```

The Bike module has a special method that is instantiated with each new instance of the Bike object. This method allows adding a test ride to the array of test rides for logging each specific test ride on a specific bike. Lastly the Bike Model is exported for other modules to use. 

```javascript
BikeMdl.prototype.addRide = function(customer, employee, miles, date, done) {
  if (!this.rides) {
    this.rides = [];
  }
  this.rides.push({
    customer: customer,
    employee: employee,
    miles: miles,
    date:date
  });
  this.save(done);
};

module.exports = BikeMdl;
```

### Application and Routing

Now that the models are defined above, the controller functionality is defined in the app.js file in the root directory and the `routes.js` file in the `/routes` directory. 

#### App Module

The `app.js` file is the entry point to the application and defines how the application will function. The code within the file is as follows:

```javascript
var express = require('express');      // ← use express
var app = express();                   // ← set express instance
var path = require('path');            // ← setup path service to publish directory

                                       // ↓ publish the static public path
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
require('./routes/routes')(app);       // ← pass the express instance into the routes

app.listen(3000);                      // ← express listen on port 3000
```

#### Routes

For the purpose of simplicity, much of the application logic takes place in the route handlers themselves. In a production node application, this functionality would typically be abstracted out along with using middleware to handle things like authentication. Lets look at an example for how new documents are created with the application. The functionality for how a new bike is added into the application is a good place to start, in the `routes.js` module: 

```javascript
//// ▶▶ BIKE add new bike ◀◀ ////
app.post('/api/bike/create',jsonParser, function(req,res){
  bike.createAndSave(
    req.body.vin,
    req.body.year,
    req.body.make,
    req.body.model,
    req.body.description,
    req.body.condition,
    req.body.mileage,
    req.body.price,
  function(err,done) {
    if (err) {
      res.status = 400;
      res.send(err.toString());
      return;
    }

    res.status=201;
    res.send(done);
    return;
  });
});
```

Using the createAndSave method defined in the bike.js module allows us to easily add this entry into the database. Once the entry is added we can use the indexes we defined using Ottoman for the Bike Model as methods to query for a list of bikes, or a specific bike. This example in the `routes.js` module uses the refdoc index defined for stockID in the Bike Model:

```javascript
//// ▶▶ BIKE find one◀◀ ////
app.get('/api/bike/findOne/:id',function(req,res) {
  bike.findByStockID(
    req.params.id,
  function(err,stock) {
    if (err) {
      res.status = 400;
      res.send(err);
      return;
    }
    if(stock && stock.length > 0) {
      res.status = 202;
      res.send(stock);
      return;
    } else {
      bike.findByVin( req.params.id, function(err,vin) {
        if (err) {
          res.status = 400;
          res.send(err);
          return;
        }
        if (vin && vin.length > 0) {
          res.status = 202;
          res.send(vin);
          return;
        } else {
          res.status = 202;
          res.send("not found");
          return;
        }
      });
    }
  });
});
```

One of the most powerful features in Couchbase version 4.0 and later, is the query API.  By using N1QL queries we can perform structured queries against JSON documents stored within Couchbase.  Ottoman makes use of this feature by providing a default generic query method for each type of object you defined with an Ottoman model.  The example for how this can be used for the Bike Model is also in the `routes.js` module: 

```javascript
//// ▶▶ BIKE generic find ◀◀ ////
app.get('/api/bike/find', function(req,res) {
  bike.find(req.query, function (err, done) {
    if (err) {
      res.status = 400;
      res.send(err);
      return;
    }
    res.status = 202;
    res.send(done);
  });
});
```

Similar routes and functionality are defined in the routes.js module for the other two Object types we defined in our model (ie: customers and employees). An Object Mapper rapidly speeds up development time and helps to create a powerful pattern language for the application can interact with complex objects while being completely abstracted from the storage layer.  An example for this is the rides array of embedded objects that were defined in the Bike Model. This allows the application to effectively log a list of test rides mapped to the specific customer, specific employee, and stored with each bike.  Using Ottoman to model the objects on top of Couchbase, means not have to worry about how those complex relationships are stored in the storage layer, and not having to write all of that code that extracts and represents those stored items to the application.  For example, the route that adds a new test ride in the `routes.js` module: 

- Checks if the bike exists for the specified vin number
- Checks if the customer exists for the specified customer email address
- Checks if the employee exists for the specified employee email address
- Adds an entry into the ride history based on the above information, mileage and ride date.

Handling the Object mapping to the storage tier makes life significantly easier and allows for rapid prototyping. Here is the example in the `routes.js` module that performs the above steps:

```javascript
//// ▶▶ BIKE create ride ◀◀ ////
app.post('/api/bike/ride/create',jsonParser, function(req, res) {
  bike.findByVin(req.body.vin, function(err,curBikes) {
    if (err) {
      res.status = 400;
      res.send(err);
      return;
    }
    if (curBikes) {
      customer.findByEmail(
        req.body.custEmail,
      function(err, curCustomers) {
        if (err) {
          res.status = 400;
          res.send(err);
          return;
        }
        if (curCustomers) {
          employee.findByEmail(
            req.body.emplEmail,
          function(err, curEmployees) {
            if (err) {
              res.status = 400;
              res.send(err);
              return;
            }
            if (curEmployees) {
              curBikes[0].addRide(
                curCustomers[0],
                curEmployees[0],
                req.body.miles,
                new Date(),
              function(err) {
                if(err){
                  res.status = 400;
                  res.send(err);
                  return;
                }
                res.status = 201;
                res.send(curBikes[0]);
                return;
              });
            }
          });
        }
      });
    }
  });
});
```
