# Ottoman Vs SDK Comparison

This document outlines subtle differences between Ottoman and Node.js SDK
and also demonstrate the value proposition (advantages) that Ottoman brings over Node.js SDK.

## Value Proposition (Benefits)

### Data Quality
Defining structure to data, validating data and enforcing constraints using lightweight code patterns.

### Affordability

Open Source, secure, fully supported, less maintenance overhead, less infrastructure Affordability, extensible and can work with any Javascript or Typescript native application.

### Agility

Be a leader in your space, build and deliver applications quickly and timely. Spend your time solving business problems rather than coding.

### Adaptability

Don't need specialized skills, all you need is to know JavaScript or TypeScript and you are good to go.

### Supportability and Sustainability

Leave the burden of scanning and patching the software for security vulnerabilities on us. Get constant software updates to align with server releases and get full support from our support team and large developer community.


Affordability, Adaptability, Supportability and Sustainability are available by default across all features in Ottoman.
